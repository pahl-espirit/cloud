== CaaS Connect (Content as a Service)

[IMPORTANT]
====
This service is usage-based.
A valid CaaS license is required
====

The Content as a Service (hereafter referred to as CaaS) is the component that runs on the FirstSpirit server.
It enables the compilation and dispatch of information to the https://docs.e-spirit.com/module/caas/CaaS_Platform_Documentation_EN.html[CaaS platform].
The information concerns all new, changed or deleted editorial content of the used FirstSpirit project.

CaaS offers companies the agility necessary for this customer communication.
It enables the provision of content fragments and has an interface for their retrieval.
Without any additional implementation effort, data can thus be reused indefinitely.
Publishing to a targeted channel is no longer necessary.
In accordance with the best-of-breed philosophy, the design and composition of the presented contents are thus completely detached from FirstSpirit.
This increases independence, flexibility and speed in project implementation.
