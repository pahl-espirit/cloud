The Intelligent Content Engine module provides FirstSpirit with numerous functions that allow editors to represent even the most complex use cases relating to A/B testing, real-time targeting, and personalization.
Despite the complexity, you can take full advantage of the benefits of FirstSpirit via the cloud-based implementation, even at times of unpredictable load peaks:
The Intelligent Content Engine does not place additional strain on your current hardware.
Simple things remain simple and complex things become possible.
Thanks to the integration into FirstSpirit, the highly dynamic system remains very easy to manage - even without in-depth knowledge of the system.
