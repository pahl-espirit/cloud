=== Module Development
For module development in your cloud environment an initial setup is required.
Please contact our Technical Support. 

Please let us know the *name of the git-repository*.

Each Code repository initially comes with two branches:

* The development branch is the continuous integration branch connected through the build server to DEV stage.
* The master branch is the release branch and connected to QA stage.
If you need the  module on your productive stage, please contact our Technical Support including the following information
+
*Necessary information about the FSM module*
+
** Module name
** Group-ID
** Artifact-ID
** Artifact-Classifier
** Version

=== Setup local Deployment
To resolve FirstSpirit specific dependencies you'll have to add the e-Spirit Cloud artifactory to your maven settings.
Check out the current development branch of your desired module.
You'll find our git stash here https://git.e-spirit.hosting   

=== Invoke Build Pipeline

==== Generally
All projects in our git supports the gitflow workflow, which we recommend.
Every push you'll make to the development branch will trigger the build server to try to build and deploy your module to your FirstSpirit DEV stage.
The result of the successful build will be stored in your internal snapshot artifactory.

The module needs to have unit tests to make the build successful.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that after every deployment an immediate restart of the FirstSpirit server is needed in ordner for all the changes to take effect.

==== Mirroring Git repository without a local copy
If you haven’t cloned the repository before, you can mirror it to a new home by 

[source,GIT]
.Git commands
----
$git clone --mirror git@git.e-spirit.hosting/upstream-repository.git

$ cd upstream-repository.git
$ git push --mirror git@git.e-spirit.hosting/new-location.git
----

This will get all the branches and tags that are available in the upstream repository and will replicate those into the new location.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Don’t use `git push --mirror` in repositories that weren’t cloned by `--mirror` as well.
It’ll overwrite the remote repository with your local references (and your local branches).
This is not what we want.
Read the next section to discover what to do in these cases.

Also git clone `--mirror` is prefered over git clone `--bare` because the former also clones git notes and some other attributes.

==== Mirroring a git repository if you already have a local working copy
By working copy, we mean a “normal” repository, in which you have the files that are being tracked into git and where you perform commands like `git add` and so on.

In this case, you may have a lot of local branches and tags that you don’t want to copy to the new location.
But you do have references to remote branches.
You can view them with `git branches -r`.
If you pay attention to that list, though, you may notice that you have a lot of branches that were already deleted in the upstream repository.
Why?

==== Cleaning old references to remote branches 
By default, when you do a `git fetch` or `git pull`, git will not delete the references to branches that were deleted in the upstream repository 
(you may view them in your `.git/refs/remotes` dir).
We need to clean those old references before mirroring them to a new location.

To do so, run `git fetch --prune`.

This will update your references to the origin repository and also clean the stale branches reported by `git branch -r`.

==== Finally mirroring the repository to a new location 
Now we’re ready to send those updated references back to the `origin` repository:

[source, GIT]
----
git push --prune 
git@git.e-spirit.hosting:/new-location.git 
+refs/remotes/origin/*:refs/heads/*
+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
----

We want those references inside the `*.git/refs/remotes/origin*` to be the LOCAL references in the new location.
The local references there will be stored in the `refs/heads` dir.
Same thing happens to tags.

The `+` sign indicates that we want to *overwrite* any reference there may already exist.
`--prune` means we want to delete any reference that may exist there if we don’t have such reference in our `*refs/remotes/origin/**` (and tags) references.

==== Best practises

* Please do not push to the master branch.
* Rather do a pull request from development to master branch.
* Every push to the master branch will build a release which is stored in your internal artifactory.
* This artifact gets installed on the QA stage.
* To get the module installed on your FirstSpirit Production stage during next maintenance please file a ticket via help@e-spirit.com including following information 
** Group-ID
** Artifact-ID
** Artifact-Classifier
** Version

=== Setup your Maven tool to use e-Spirit Cloud Artifactory 

* Please open following URL: +
https://git.e-spirit.hosting/projects/CLOUD/repos/public/browse +
_Only users with the role Git-User can access to this repository._
* Navigate to the `maven-settings/settings.xml` file in the Bitbucket file browser.
* Copy the content of the file or download it to your local maven directory.
A common location for User Home Directory is `.m2/`.
+
[NOTE]
====
For more information please have a look at the official documentation at https://maven.apache.org/settings.html.

+
* Further you need to replace the following placeholders: +
+
[source,XML]
.Placeholders
----
<server>
	<username>CLOUD_USERNAME</username>
	<password>CLOUD_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD</password
	<id>...</id>
</server>
----
+
** `CLOUD_USERNAME`: This is your email address which represents your user name in FirstSpirit.
** `CLOUD_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD`: To generate your encrypted password, please
*** click https://artifactory.e-spirit.hosting/artifactory/api/security/encryptedPassword[here]
*** login with your FirstSpirit Credentials
*** the generated password will appear
** `CUSTOMER`: For the repository nodes, replace this value in following URLs with your lowercase customer name: https://artifactory.e-spirit.hosting/artifactory/CUSTOMER-release
